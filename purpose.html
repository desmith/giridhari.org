    <p><font face="Comic Sans MS, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Every 
      week we have a program in our home for the sharing of Krsna consciousness. 
      We strive to &quot;live&quot; the philosophy of Krsna consciousness throughout 
      the week to the best of our ability so that we will have something meaningful 
      to offer to our guests.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Comic Sans MS, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The format 
      is simple - we start with a traditional arotik to Their Lordships Sri-Sri 
      Radha Giridhari, during which time we have kirtana (congregational chanting), 
      then there is a class on Vedic philosophy along with a group discussion 
      so that everyone can share their realizations, ask questions, etc. After 
      the class we do our best to make sure everyone is fully satisfied by feeding
